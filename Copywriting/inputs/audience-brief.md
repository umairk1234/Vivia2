## Her Situation

She's 52, lives in the suburbs outside Dallas, works part-time as a school secretary. Married 25 years, two grown kids who don't need her much anymore.

She's not poor, not rich. She spends on Amazon, Target, Costco. She used to buy beauty creams and perfumes. Now, she hides those bottles in the bathroom because she doesn't feel like "that woman" anymore.

She still thinks of herself as a caretaker — she makes sure her husband's lunch is packed, checks in on her aging parents, spoils her grandkids. But for herself? She'll spend $40 on a face cream, not $400 on herself.

## Primary Pain Points

### Physical Pain
> "It's not just dryness. It feels like someone rubbed sandpaper down there. Even putting on jeans can hurt. Forget intimacy — half the time I'm dreading my husband even touching my arm, because I know where he wants it to go."

- Vaginal dryness (constant, not just during sex)
- Pain during sex (sometimes bleeding after)
- Daily discomfort (walking, sitting, wearing jeans)
- Burning, itching for no reason

### Emotional Pain
> "My husband thinks he's hurting me. I can see the look on his face when I wince. Then he rolls over, guilty. And then I feel guilty for making him feel guilty."

- Feels broken, defective, "less of a woman"
- Guilt over rejecting husband
- Fear he'll give up on her (or leave)
- Shame — can't even talk to friends about it
- Depression — "This is my life now"

### Medical Gaslighting
> "My doctor just said, 'use more lube' or 'this is what happens when you get older.' I walked out feeling like a crazy person."

- Dismissed by doctors repeatedly
- Told it's "normal" or "in her head"
- Given useless advice ("just use lube")
- Feels invisible, unheard, gaslit

| **Revaree** | "Works until you stop, then back to square one." |
| **Coconut oil** | "Ruined my sheets. Still in pain." |
| **Systemic HRT** | "Scared of cancer. Didn't fix the dryness anyway." |
| **Vagifem** | "Caused spotting. Panicked and stopped." |
| **Laser treatments** | "$2,500. Within 6 months, back where I started." |
| **Doctor's advice** | "'Just use more lube.' I left feeling invisible." |

## Emotional Drivers

2. **Shame** — can't talk about it, feels defective
3. **Anger** — at doctors, at the system, at her body
4. **Grief** — for her former self, her former sex life
5. **Desperation** — will try anything that might work
6. **Hope** — still believes she can feel normal again

### What Motivates Purchase
- Exhaustion from failed solutions
- Fear of relationship damage
- Anger at being dismissed
- Hope that THIS might finally work
- Trust in medical authority (doctor-led)

---

## Trust Requirements

She won't buy from a random internet brand selling hormones without:

1. **Medical authority** — Doctor backing, credentials
2. **Social proof** — Women like her with real results
3. **Safety data** — European track record, not just claims
4. **Understanding** — Proof that you GET her specific pain
5. **Risk reversal** — Money-back guarantee

---

## What She Believes

### About healthcare:
- Distrusts pharma motives (profit > patients)
- Doctors are trained to push drugs, not educate
- Men get solutions (Viagra), women get dismissed
- European healthcare is better than American

### About herself:
- NOT resigned to decline
- NOT waiting for permission
- Willing to invest in herself
- Still sees herself as vibrant, not "old and done"

### About solutions:
- Wants what WORKS, not just "natural"
- Values research-backed (international, not just US pharma-funded)
- Open to hormones if proven safe

---

## Copy Implications

### Lead with:
- Her specific pain (sandpaper, dread, excuses)
- Validation (you're not crazy, you're not broken)
- The system that failed her
- The solution she's been denied

### Build trust through:
- Doctor credibility (angry on her behalf, not lecturing)
- European standard (50 years of safe use)
- Women like her (testimonials that match her experience)
- Understanding her exact emotional journey

### Address objections:
- Safety first (gentlest estrogen, local only)
- European track record
- Money-back guarantee
- This is different from what you've tried

### Avoid:
- Clinical jargon
- Minimizing her pain ("mild discomfort")
- Generic promises ("feel great!")
- Anything that sounds like a doctor dismissing her
